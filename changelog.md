# Changelog

## alpha 3

* Sliders for RGB and LCH are isolated; RGB sliders are only visible in RGB
mode, LCH sliders in LCH mode

* Remove version number from filename and operation name (having multiple
versions of the plugin had surprising effects; this should now be impossible to
do without error)

## alpha 2

* Added weighting by hue/chroma/lightness color model

## alpha 1

* Initial release
